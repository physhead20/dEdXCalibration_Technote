\begin{abstract}

We present the calibration technique of parameterizing the energy deposited per unit length (dE/dX) as a function of momentum used to calibrate both the data and Monte Carlo samples for Run-I and Run-II. This calibration is done for a sample of $\pi, \mu$, and protons from the beamline and cross-checked using a sample of cosmic rays. The results for this calibration along with the derived calibration constants are presented.
